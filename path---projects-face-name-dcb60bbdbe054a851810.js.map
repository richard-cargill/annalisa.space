Some of the teachers remember what clothes students wear that day but then have to remember each day and some students wear a school uniform.</p>\\n<p><strong>1.b Association:</strong> Pictures association (24 teachers)\\nAssociation between names and pictures\\nConstraint and assumption: The schools don't always give pictures of their students. Some schools from the surveys like in India or South of Italy don't have tech equipment to take pictures, print them or to store in a database. Some teachers that had a class roll with pictures also said that \\\" They looked different from their pics\\\". Teachers often need to take a picture with their personal smartphone and this appears not to be very convenient when they have more classes. More important: this will raise constraints also from a privacy point of view.</p>\\n<p><strong>2. Games:</strong> Name games, Rhymes, Nicknames (14 teachers)\\nPlaying names games or giving students nicknames\\nConstraint and assumption: Teachers often don't have time to spend, organise, plan games to remember names. Some teachers have 300 students in a week and they need to spend lots of time inventing a game or researching nicknames with just the scope of remembering students names.</p>\\n<p><strong>3.
